Hi! Nice to meet you 👋,
I’m Anuradha (she/her), a perpetual developer and hobby enthusiast. I’ve been learning different ways to creatively express myself as a developer and taking it one day at a time.

During my downtime, I enjoy working on my own projects in the form of portfolios, digital web applications, or fun, interactive experiences. When I’m away from the screen, I love playing badminton, chasing sunsets, and go hiking.

Currently I am:

Enjoying the summer sun 🌞
Studying Master's of Mathematics in Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo
Exploring new places!

Previously I was:

Working full time @HP Inc as a Software Developer 👩🏻‍💻
Interning @HP Inc as a Software Developer 👩🏻‍💻

Hit Me Up 💫
If you’re interested in hearing more about any of the above shoot me an email. ✌🏼
